3d racing game where people buy weapons and items before the match based on their
previous winnings and tires can get shot out
racing to gain poisition and inflict damage to other racers cars... tires blown etcc.
massive damage but equals small speed penalties... to elongate the race

together as a team.
at the end there is no finishe line just lanes that open up to the final inner stage
